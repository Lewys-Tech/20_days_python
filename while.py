# while loops
i = 0
while i < 3:
    print("meow")
    i += 1
    # Notice how changing the operator to i < 3 allows our code to function as intended.
    # We begin by counting with 0 and it iterates through our loop three times, producing three meows. Also, notice how i += 1 is the same as saying i = i + 1.
